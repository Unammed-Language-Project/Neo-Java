<h1 align="center">Y# Compiler</h1>
<p>This repository is the official repository for Y# (the temporary name I gave the compiler). It contains the entire compiler.</p>

<h3 align-"center">How to run</h3>
<p>To run Y# yourself, you need a few prerequisites. They are: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Java 11 (Thats the version this is running on so can't guarantee anything for other versions)</li>
 <li>A Java IDE/Code Editor</li>
</ul>
<p>To run it, first run <code>git clone</code> to clone the repository. Then, cd into the repo and run Y.java! 
Note: You can either pass a path to the program when you run it, or you can start the file without args to pop into a repl, where you can type in statements.</p>
